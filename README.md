## Features

    - AI comes with two difficulties, Easy and Hard
        - Easy - AI makes random legal moves
        - Hard - AI makes moves using minimax algorithm 
- Customize names before starting a game
- Board effects such as hover, highlighting the winning lines, etc.
- Play again button to continue playing and add scores
- Reset button to restart the game and scores
- Home button to return to title screen

## Issues
- Slight delay during the first turn of playing with AI Hard due to the implementation of the minimax algorithm (it gets better after there are less possible moves the AI can make)

## To implement
- Optimize code
